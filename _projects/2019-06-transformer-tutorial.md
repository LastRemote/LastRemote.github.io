I have made a transformer tutorial for the upcoming TensorFlow r2.0. This tutorial focuses on expository and assumes less understanding of NLP and TF functions compared to the current [official tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/beta/tutorials/text/transformer). The tutorial is available [here](https://github.com/LastRemote/examples/blob/master/community/en/Easy_Transformer.ipynb).
