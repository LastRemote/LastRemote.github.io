I am a current MS candidate in CS at Columbia University with a strong interest of natural language generation, and a Google Developer Expert in Machine Learning. I have implemented a [seq2seq](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473) model for poetry generation at JD.COM, and a [Transformer tutorial](projects/2019-transformer-tutorial) for TensorFlow r2.0, and I am looking forward to research and/or internship opportunities that focus on conversation model, machine translation or other areas of NLG. 

The construction of this page is still in progress.
